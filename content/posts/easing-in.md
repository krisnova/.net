As I begin settling into a new flow of my life I find myself finding tremendous sanctuary and peace with myself. 

I notice this internal tranquility seems to be related to my exodus of social media.

A few months away from my online addiction has left me with two fundamental conclusions.

First, My relationship with social media was "selfish", "self-centered", and "self-righteous" in nature. Egotistical.

Next, I believe I am not alone in this experience. 

Candidly, I don't see a lot of hope on social media.
I see mass demand of attention. Serotonin farming. Attention farming.
Each cry out for external validation slightly more desperate than the last.

I deeply believe everyone is virtuous, as they define it.
In most cases, I deeply believe the majority of the world's virtuous are common.
We all want peace, joy, safety, and comfort. We all want to smile.

Social media seems to have a way of pushing dialogue to extremes.
I remember feeling compelled to send stronger and stronger signals into the abyss.
I remember feeling the need to out-perform my previous display of extreme morality.
I remember feeling that I must prove to the world, that my opinion, was the most virtuous, and the most engaging.
There was no time to lose.

Virtue signaling. Aggressive. Virtue signaling.

Broadcasting virtue to the world will never provide internal fulfillment. 
Virtue signaling is effective in shifting public perception, but remains powerless in shifting an internal self-image.

Social media has provided a mass platform for extraordinary volumes of external engagement.
However it has robbed us of the most critical dialogue, our dialogue with ourselves.

I see millions of empty users crying out for more validation.

Slipping further and further away from a sense of self.
Slipping further and further into the delusion that somehow external acceptance will remedy the void growing inside.

The ego.

Social media grows the ego.

I am attempting to kill mine, or at least substantially weaken it. 

Over the past months I have began mountain climbing again, and in many cases I have rediscovered a sense of self-respect for my ability to do things when nobody is watching.
This confidence has stuck with me, and has soothed the black void inside me that had developed from my online addiction.

I will continue to send updates on my blog, and I intend on adding more content on my alpine climbing.
I will continue to stream on Twitch, and work on my technical projects.

This blog, and the RSS feed will slowly grow into read-only automation that will publish to all of my channels. 

I do not intend on engaging in social media moving forward. I am too happy to change anything at the moment.

Stay tuned for more.
