As I begin settling into a new flow of my life I find myself finding tremendous sanctuary and peace with myself. 

I notice this internal tranquility seems to be related to my exodus of social media.

A few months away from my online addiction has left me with two fundamental conclusions.

First, My relationship with social media was "selfish", "self-centered", and "self-righteous" in nature. Egotistical.

Next, I believe I am not alone in this experience. 

Candidly, I don't see a lot of hope on social media.
The world doesn't seem to be using it to organize itself for the better.
In fact, many of the virtue campaigns that served as a point of hope for me, have turned.

I can't help but see a mass demand of attention. Serotonin farming. Accolade farming.
Each cry out for external validation slightly more desperate than the last.

I deeply believe everyone is virtuous, as they define it.
In most cases, I deeply believe the majority of the world's virtuous are common.
We all want peace, joy, safety, and comfort. We all want to smile.

Social media seems to have a way of pushing dialogue to extremes.
I remember feeling compelled to send stronger and more righteous signals into the abyss.
I remember feeling the need to out-perform my previous display of extreme morality.
I remember feeling that I must prove to the world, to the nameless and faceless audience, that my opinion was virtuous.

Everyone was watching.

There was no time to lose.

I must deliver.

Time -- is of the essence.

Regardless of how delightful, jarring, shocking, or aggressively virtuous my content was, internally I remained empty.

Every perfect post was equally as rotten.

Virtue signaling. Aggressive. Virtue signaling.
And for who? Who was I trying to convince?

Broadcasting virtue to the world will never provide internal fulfillment. 
Virtue signaling is effective in shifting public perception, but remains powerless in shifting an internal self-image.

Social media has provided a mass platform for extraordinary volumes of external engagement.
However it has robbed us of the most critical dialogue, our dialogue with ourselves.

I see millions of empty users crying out for more validation.

Slipping further and further away from a sense of self.
Slipping further and further into the delusion that somehow external acceptance will remedy the void growing inside.

The ego.

Social media aggravates the ego.

I am attempting to kill mine, or at least substantially weaken it. 

As with an trauma, there is an inverse response to counter traumatic damage.
You "over index". 
You "over rotate".
My experience has shown me that the only thing to gain from looking to social media for validation is an extremely aggravated ego starving for true acceptance.
The more I turned to social media to measure myself, the more it stole myself from me.

My ego had turned.

Over the past months I have began mountain climbing again, and in many cases I have rediscovered a sense of self-respect for my ability to accomplish my goals when nobody is watching.
This confidence has stuck with me, and has soothed the black ego void inside me that had developed from my online addiction.

I will continue to send updates on my blog, and I intend on adding more content on my alpine climbing.
I will continue to stream on Twitch, and work on my technical projects.

This blog, and the RSS feed will slowly grow into read-only automation that will publish to all of my channels. 

I do not intend on engaging in social media moving forward. I am too happy to change anything at the moment.

Stay tuned for more.
